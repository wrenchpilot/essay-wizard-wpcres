An open-source WordPress plugin enabling student-led editing of written work.  

== Description ==

STEP 1: BUILD ASSIGNMENT

* Dashboard guides you through creation of scaffolding questions

* Browse the multidisciplinary question bank or create new questions

* Questions can be tailored to emphasize both discipline- specific content and universal writing and rhetoric skills

STEP 2: DISSEMINATE TO STUDENTS

* Scalable design means an assignment can be completed by innumerable students with no addition to instructor workload

STEP 3: DOWNLOAD RESPONSES

* View students’ progress through various steps of a single assignment

* Track students’ progress over the course of the semester

* Because students have self-edited according to the customized rubric, further grading is optional
